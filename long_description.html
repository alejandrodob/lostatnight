Locate Cities from ISS
======================

Help us to georeference the position of cities which appear in the ISS images.

We are members of the Group of Extragalactic Astrophysics and Astronomical Instrumentation from the of Universidad Coplutense de Madrid. Among our activities is a study of light pollution and the energy consumption derived from it. We use images taken from the International Space Station as part of our investigations, provided by Earth Science and Remote Sensing Unit, NASA-Johnson Space Center. "The Gateway to Astronaut Photography of Earth."

To compare the images with the different light sources on the earth, we need to know the city's location. Due to the large number of images, we need your help. Some of these pictures are from unknown locations for us, and it is very difficult to identify them in the pictures. However, a lot of people around the world will know the cities. We need you to identify the cities and connect them with their position point on the map. This application allows you to do this.

The process is very easy. The ISS image will be loaded in the left panel and a map on the right one. If we know the position of the center of the picture, the map will be centered, and a whole map will be displayed instead. The aim is try to identify the city. You have some simple tools, including zooming in and out, dragging, and even rotating the image (click on Shift and the left mouse button). 

When you identify a picture, just click on the map to identify its position. The longitude and latitude coordinates will appear on the list. If you make a mistake, you can delete the point. Just select it and click on "Delete".

When you finish, click on Save, and another image will be loaded. If you don't know about the picture, just click on "Don't know".

If you need more information about a particular picture, you can click on "ISS picture data", and the NASA data will be displayed. Finally, you also can share it through Twitter.

We apreciate your job very much
Also you can contribute on our other apps [Night Cities ISS](http://crowdcrafting.org/app/nightcitiesiss/) (georreferencing images) and [DarkSkies](http://crowdcrafting.org/app/darkskies/) (Identifying Images).
